# hello-world
My first repository;
My name is Steve, and I am new to programming. I have touched on this topic before, but that was many years ago, when personal computing was in it's infancy. I live in Wichita, Kansas, USA. I hope to become skilled in this new endeavor. I will be using various test beds and development boards and microcontrollers (Raspberry Pi, WyPi, etc.). I am interested in sensors and machine learning with applications in robotics and home control, to name a couple of prospective areas.
